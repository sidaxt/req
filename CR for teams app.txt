Desc:
ChatDSI has to enabled as an Teams App for UAT environment. We are submitting the package file along with the ticket.

Kindly make this App auto-installed in Teams client. Can you add this App only to below list of users:

If that is not possible to add the App to set of users mentioned, then add this app to the AD group - "SG-DSI-AOAI_DEV_TEAM". Object ID for this group is "0eac92ad-f3e5-40c6-b314-47688f7adcc0".


Justification:
Currently, ChatDSI UAT is accessible through browser (URL: https://chatdsi-general-assistant-uat.azurewebsites.net/). Now, we would like to have it as an App in Teams itself. So as to do that, we would need auto-installation of ChatDSI as a Teams App and to be enabled for UAT users. Once UAT is successful, this can be enabled for Production too.


Implementation Plan:
Upload the app package (ChatDSI_UAT.zip) into Teams Admin portal and enable it for specific set of users.

Risk and Impact analysis:
No Risk, If something went wrong, the App will not be installed in users PC and this will not affect the existing setup
